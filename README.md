# Introduction

This is a basic rest api server made with nodejs and express, it uses MongoDB and mongoose for managing it.

# Instalation

Run npm install in the folder where the package.json is.

Then use a tool like nodemon to run the server.

You will need to connect to a db from mLab

You will need to provide an .env file and set it up like this (example.env provided):
```
PORT=8080

MONGODB_CNN= connection url

SECRET_OR_PRIVATE_KEYS=Key for the token validation, must be something like if your cat walks on your keyboard "divbadsiobvoieOBFBibiÂ·&%)rh545))o hd)"rBFWIWQBHEF928"
```
remember to give network access to your db as public
